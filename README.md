# Metsan_Otus v1.1
Official page for my youtube channel. Main goal was to have a place to host all my vlog scripts in one place. :-)

Personal vlog page done with modern technology and methods. Jamstack is a popular new stack to create modern websites. Tools used in this project include Gatsby, Netlify CMS, GraphQl and Netflidy Identity.

This is for my YouTube persona and a place to have all my scipts. I don't release my scripts elsewhere so I thought a vlog/blog-site would be perfect for that.

Plans for v2:

* Rework the Vlog page categories to use a serverless function where I get all diff categories. Right now it uses GraphQL and its not perfect.
* See Netlify/Gatsby support for multilanguage versions and make a english version for my Forest Entity channel.
*  Maybe rework the UI/UX.
* Add comments feature.
